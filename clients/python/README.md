# pgque-py

Python client for [PgQue](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque) — the PgQ-based
universal PostgreSQL queue. Thin wrapper over `pgque-api` SQL functions:
`send`, `receive`, `ack`, `nack`, plus a polling `Consumer` with
`LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` wakeup.

## Install

```bash
pip install pgque
```

Requires Python 3.10+ and PostgreSQL 14+ with the PgQue schema installed
(`\i pgque.sql` — no extension required).

## Database permissions

The connecting database role needs `pgque_reader` to consume (`receive`, `ack`, `nack`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`) and `pgque_writer` to produce (`send`, `send_batch`). The two are **siblings** — neither inherits the other. An app that both produces and consumes (the typical case for code using this client) must be granted **both** roles:

```sql
grant pgque_reader to your_app_user;
grant pgque_writer to your_app_user;
```

See [`docs/reference.md` — Roles and grants](../../docs/reference.md#roles-and-grants) for the full role table.

## Quickstart

```python
import pgque

with pgque.connect("postgresql://localhost/mydb") as client:
    # one-time setup (typically in a migration)
    client.conn.execute("select pgque.subscribe('orders', 'order_worker')")
    client.conn.commit()

    # producer: commit once to publish both calls atomically
    event_id = client.send("orders", {"order_id": 42}, type="order.created")
    batch_ids = client.send_batch("orders", "order.created", [
        {"order_id": 43},
        {"order_id": 44},
    ])
    client.conn.commit()
    print(event_id, batch_ids)

# consumer (separate process / thread)
consumer = pgque.Consumer(
    dsn="postgresql://localhost/mydb",
    queue="orders",
    name="order_worker",
)

@consumer.on("order.created")
def handle_order(msg: pgque.Message) -> None:
    print(f"got {msg.type}: {msg.payload}")

# Optional: catch-all handler for types with no specific handler.
# Without it, messages with unhandled types are logged at WARNING and acked.
# Register a `*` handler if you want to fail/nack/route unknown types yourself.
@consumer.on("*")
def handle_unknown(msg: pgque.Message) -> None:
    print(f"unhandled type {msg.type!r}: {msg.payload}")

consumer.start()  # blocks until SIGTERM / SIGINT
```

## Tests

Integration tests require a running PostgreSQL with the PgQue schema
installed. Set `PGQUE_TEST_DSN` and run pytest:

```bash
PGQUE_TEST_DSN=postgresql://postgres:pgque_test@localhost/pgque_test \
    pytest clients/python/tests
```

Without `PGQUE_TEST_DSN`, the tests skip.
